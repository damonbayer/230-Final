## Instructions

Maximum number of people in a group is 3 - you should find a published paper related to the topics we discussed in the class; the paper should propose a new methodology or algorithm, which can be considered as an extension of what we covered in this course -  you then need to implement the proposed algorithm (in R, Matlab, Python, â€¦) and apply it to simulated or read data (or both) - your final report should be maximum 7 pages (12pt, single space, excluding plots, tables, algorithms, and references) - in your report, you should include these parts: abstract, introduction (explaining the motivation behind the new algorithm), methodology (explaining the algorithm), results (applying your algorithm to simulated or real data), and discussion (shortcomings of this new algorithm and how it can be improved).
