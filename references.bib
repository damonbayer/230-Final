	Abstract = {Multisurface pattern separation is a mathematical method for distinguishing between elements of two pattern sets. Each element of the pattern sets is comprised of various scalar observations. In this paper, we use the diagnosis of breast cytology to demonstrate the applicability of this method to medical diagnosis and decision making. Each of 11 cytological characteristics of breast fine-needle aspirates reported to differ between benign and malignant samples was graded 1 to 10 at the time of sample collection. Nine characteristics were found to differ significantly between benign and malignant samples. Mathematically, these values for each sample were represented by a point in a nine-dimensional space of real variables. Benign points were separated from malignant ones by planes determined by linear programming. Correct separation was accomplished in 369 of 370 samples (201 benign and 169 malignant). In the one misclassified malignant case, the fine-needle aspirate cytology was so definitely benign and the cytology of the excised cancer so definitely malignant that we believe the tumor was missed on aspiration. Our mathematical method is applicable to other medical diagnostic and decision-making problems.},

  abstract="The paper introduces two new data augmentation algorithms for sampling the parameters of a binary or multinomial logit model from their posterior distribution within a Bayesian framework. The new samplers are based on rewriting the   underlying random utility model in such away that only differences of utilities are involved. As a consequence, the error term in the logit model has a logistic distribution. If the logistic distribution is approximated by a finite scale mixture   of normal distributions, auxiliary mixture sampling can be implemented to sample from the posterior of the regression parameters. Alternatively, a data augmented Metropolis--Hastings algorithm can be formulated by approximating the logistic   distribution by a single normal distribution. A comparative study on five binomial and multinomial data sets shows that the new samplers are superior to other data augmentation samplers and to Metropolis--Hastings sampling without data augmentatio  n.",
